# ccl

blazing fast data structures for Rust

## performance?

Here are some benchmarks for the `DHashMap` hashmap. You can run them yourself by executing `cargo bench` in the ccl-bench directory.

## todo list

- add a new interface api for managing borrows to prevent deadlocks

- explore new concurrent hashmap designs possibly based on c++ junction
